**Tools & Environment Use**

>  **REACT:**

![](vertopal_ce2320211cc14b97bd3a0d83f299befe/media/image8.png){width="2.4763888888888888in"
height="1.6534722222222222in"}

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building
interactive user interfaces. It is particularly well-suited for creating
single-page applications (SPAs) where the content is dynamically updated
without requiring a full page reload. React utilizes a component-based
architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI elements that
manage their own state .One of the key features of React is its use of a
virtual DOM (Document Object Model). Instead of directly manipulating
the browser\'s DOM, React creates a lightweight virtual representation
of the DOM in memory. This virtual DOM is then compared with the actual
DOM, and only the differences are updated, resulting in faster and more
efficient rendering.

>  **WHY USE REACT?**

-   High performance due to virtual DOM

-   Reusable components for efficient development

-   Rich ecosystem with tools and libraries

-   Strong community support and active development

-   Declarative and composable nature

> MongoDB is a popular open-source, NoSQL database management system
> that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing
> data. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB is
> document-oriented, meaning it stores data in flexible, JSON-like
> documents instead of rows and columns.
>
> One of MongoDB\'s key features is its flexibility in handling diverse
> and evolving data structures. With MongoDB, you can store data of
> varying types and structures within the same collection, making it
> well-suited for applications with rapidly changing data requirements.

height="1.2763888888888888in"}

Node.js, introduced by Ryan Dahl in 2009, is a revolutionary open-source
JavaScript runtime environment designed for executing JavaScript code
outside the confines of a web browser. Its architecture is event-driven
and asynchronous, facilitating non-blocking I/O operations. This enables
Node.js to efficiently handle concurrent connections without becoming
blocked by waiting for responses. Unlike traditional server-side
environments, Node.js follows a single-threaded, event loop model,
utilizing a lightweight approach that makes it highly scalable. Central
to its success is npm (Node Package Manager), which offers a vast
repository of reusable libraries and modules, empowering developers to
easily integrate third-party functionalities into their applications.

This versatility extends to a wide range of use cases, including web
servers, RESTful APIs, real-time applications, command-line tools, and
desktop applications. Node.js benefits from a thriving community that
provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and support, making it
accessible for developers of all levels. With its cross-platform
compatibility and performance, Node.js has become a cornerstone of
modern web development, empowering developers to build high-performance
and scalable applications.

 **Why Use Node.js ?**

-   **Scalability**: Node.js is well-suited for building scalable
    applications, particularly those requiring high concurrency, thanks
    to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

-   **Performance**: Leveraging Chrome\'s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js
    offers excellent performance, making it suitable for handling
    I/O-heavy tasks efficiently.

-   **Full-Stack JavaScript**: Node.js allows developers to use
    JavaScript on both the client and server sides of an application,
    facilitating full-stack development with a single language.

-   **Vast Ecosystem**: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of open-source
    libraries and modules available via NPM (Node Package Manager),
    covering a wide range of functionalities and accelerating
    development.

-   **Community Support**: With a large and active community of
    developers, Node.js benefits from ongoing contributions, support,
    and knowledge sharing, ensuring its continuous improvement and
    evolution.

-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Node.js runs on various operating
    systems, enabling developers to write code once and deploy it across
    multiple environments, improving efficiency and reducing development
    time.

**[6.2 Limitation of Current System]{.underline}**

1\) Less Interactive and Cooperation:

> Most perceptions of interactivity are that it is an inherently good
> thing, that it will change confusions which arise in the mind of
> customer. So, it is the foremost limitation of current car service
> system.
>
> 2\) Time Consuming:
>
> In Our current system, all the process are carried out by human so
> naturally it require more time and in that sense, it will require more
> time to complete transaction. A person is needed to enter details for
> every individual newly registered applicant.
>
> 3\) Book Record:
>
> In every manual system has more books keeping. Like in manual Car
> Service System has so many registers like car details register,
> another are customer register, bookings register, details record of
> each and every booking, so the system have high book keeping to
> maintain manual registers rather than computer software.
>
> 4\) Report Creation:
>
> Information processing is very lengthy and time consuming. So actual
> data required to create or generate reports which are not on time
> provided generation is delay until required data is produced.

5\) Online Appointment:

> In existing car Service System, they haven't facility about auto
> manageged online appointment for services if they had that facility
> then all the information like date, time, booking confirmation etc to
> all the customers.
>
> 6\) Security /level is low:
>
> In Our current system all the work that is done carried out the
> register and so there are not any security criteria to guard our data
> and any person can open data register and make changes and make effect
> on reports.

**Requirement Analysis**

> A fact finding study was undertaken to study the activities involved
> in marketing system of company. We have visited the various person of
> the marketing system. The existing system was studied by means of
>
> 1\) Interview

>
> 3\) Observation
>
> **6.3 Requirement Specification**
>

**7.3 SECURITY ISSUES**

-   **VALIDATION OF INPUT AND OUTPUT DATA**

> All data used by the website must be validated for type for example
> numeric data length and syntax and business rules need to be save to
> be in a browser, email client or other software and integrity of any
> data that is return must be checked.

-   **DIRECT ACCESS DATA**

> If data exist, it can potentially review or expected. Avoid storing
> data if you do not on the website and its database. Poorly develop
> system may be accessed to data through insufficient input and output
> data validation or poor system security.

-   **Session Management and Authentication in React**

    -   Implement session management using secure state management
        libraries like Redux or Context API combined with local storage
        or session storage to store session tokens securely.

    -   Utilize authentication libraries such as Auth0 or Firebase
        Authentication for robust user authentication, including
        features like social login and JWT (JSON Web Token)
        authentication.

    -   Implement client-side routing with libraries like React Router,
        ensuring that authenticated routes are protected and
        unauthorized users are redirected to login pages.

-   **Data Encryption and Transmission in React**

    -   Utilize HTTPS encryption for all communication between the React
        application and the backend server, ensuring that sensitive data
        is transmitted securely over the network.

    -   Implement client-side encryption using libraries like CryptoJS
        to encrypt sensitive data before transmission and decrypt it on
        the server side to prevent data interception attacks.

    -   store sensitive data securely in the React application using
        libraries like Redux Persist or secure local storage solutions
        to prevent unauthorized access by malicious scripts or browser
        extensions.

>
>  Testing is advantageous in several ways. Firstly, the defects found
> help in the process of making software and reliable. Secondly, even if
> the defects found are not corrected, testing gives an idea as to how
> reliable the software is.
>
>  Thirdly, over time, the record of defects found reveals the most

>  **Unit Testing**
>
>  As per as unit testing is concerned I did it at the time of the
> coding in an informal but extensive way, so as to reduce number of
> problems arising out of incorrect variable, function names etc.. Care
> was taken to check for any infinite loop that exists in code before
> executing the code. Each module was tested whether they cover the
> functionalities specified by the client or not? The functionalities
> were performed for valid data or not?
>
> For invalid data proper messages were displayed or not? etc.
>
>  **Integration Testing**
>
>  Unit testing tests a unit of code (module or program) after coding
> of that unit is completed. Integration testing tests whether the
> various programs that make up a system, interface with each other as
> desired, fit together and whether the interfaces between the programs
> are correct. System testing ensures that the system meets its stated
> design specifications. Acceptance testing is testing by the users to
> ascertain whether the system developed is correct implementations of
> 1the Software Requirements Specifications.

-   In our system, user cannot access the information of how much
    service time of a car.

-   Users can't track the order.

-   Users cannot make actual payment.

-   User can not have a feature of forget password system.

**10. Future enhancements of system**

> Future Enhancement:
>
> Our system is efficient but still we can add another new feature in
> future as need arises. Our system is flexible so if need arises we can
> increases or add the requirements for our system and can extend our
> system.
>
> Once the software is developed, tested and implemented, the focus is
> laid on the support phase. The support phase focuses on change
> associated, adaptations required as the software's environment evolves
> and changes due to enhancements brought about by changing customer
> requirements.

-   We can make this system platform independent which means that it can
    work on any operating system.

-   The project can be implemented on intranet in future.

-   Project can be updated in near future as and when requirement for
    the same arises as it is very flexible in terms of expansion.

-   More security can be maintained.

-   A method to transfer the web properties can be provided direct on
    the website.

-   An intelligence appointment of services should be make efficiently.

-   We add a feature of forget password and automatic slot management
    system.

-   we can combine our service work with our studio's camera so client
    can seen service at any place which maintains a transparency.
